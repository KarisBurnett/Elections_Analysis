This script can be used for any other election. The first two examples of how this script can be used is first for cities instead of counties and adding demographics to the data. First, We can go into a more in depth look at which cities in determining if a candidate will the winner of the election. Cities would add larger amount of data and may help us understand the larger picture. Demographiccs such as: Age, sex, and ethnicity are three that are significant and in the interest of the candidates to help them understand which group to appeal to. As stated before, we need to add these inputs into the election_results.csv file in order to begin the script for it. These two examples can be used to modify the data for any election.
